polytope 0.1.1 doesn't play nice with tulip-1.1a
polytope 0.1.0 plays nice with tulip-1.1a
--> see tulip-1.1a/run_tests.py (will FAIL if polytope 0.1.1 is used)

note that tulip-1.1a seems to try and install newest version of polytope (0.1.1) from PyPi automatically (even if an older version exists, likely using pip)

one can download and manually install polytope 0.1.0 ("sudo python setup.py install") and then run ./run_tests.py with it (without recompiling tulip-1.1a), though it does seem slower

--> Need to look and see if a newer stable revision of tulip exists
--> if not, need to add a mod to tulip download (setup.py?) that cites/pulls polytope 0.1.0 as a dependency
--> should also add the run_tests.py as a test that autoruns after all is said and done to check the installation


Okay, it looks like tulip-1.2 is the latest stable release, available on PyPi. I should add/ modify the internal tulip install script to have a pypi install (and download+extract for interested users) for this instead.

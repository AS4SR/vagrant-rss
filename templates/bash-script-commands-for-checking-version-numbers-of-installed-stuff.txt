# bash script commands for checking version numbers of installed stuff(!!)
# one should uncomment and change what is needed, and add the following line to the top of the new bash script:
#!/bin/bash -e

#
# check for installation
#

#
# methods to check for existence of system-installed .deb package (installed via apt, apt-get, or dpkg):
#

#ROSVERSION_INSTALLED=`dpkg -s ros-$ROSVERSION-desktop-full | grep -m 1 "Status: install ok installed" | wc -l`
# dpkg -s ros-$ROSVERSION-desktop-full should check pkg status and return a set of strings with '...Status: install ok installed...' or '...is not installed...'
# grep should find a match and repeat it (the entire line)
# and wc -l should give 1 if installed/good-status (and 0 if "is not installed" was found)
#if [ $ROSVERSION_INSTALLED -eq 1 ]; then
#    echo "ros-$ROSVERSION-desktop-full is already installed!"
#fi

#
# methods to check for libraries of a specific name and with known directory / install location:
#
#if [ ! -f /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ompl/geometric/_geometric.so ] || [ ! -f /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ompl/app/_app.so ]
#then
#    OMPLPY_FOUND=0
#else
#    echo "OMPL geometric and OMPLapp 1.1.1 pybindings already installed!"
#    OMPLPY_FOUND=1
#fi

#
# methods to check for existence of system-installed binary/executable files:
#
#MOBILESIM_FOUND=`MobileSim --help | grep -m 1 "MobileSim 0.7.3" | wc -l`
# MobileSim -- help should run binary file and return a string with 'MobileSim 0.7.3'
# grep should find a match and repeat it
# and wc -l should give 1 if ws4py 0.3.5 was found
#if [ $MOBILESIM_FOUND -eq 1 ]; then
#    echo "MobileSim 0.7.3 already installed!"
#fi
# can also find via: $ whereis MobileSim

#
# methods to check for existence of system-installed python packages with version number:
#
#WS4PY_FOUND=`python -c "import pkg_resources; print(pkg_resources.get_distribution('ws4py').version)" | grep -m 1 -o "0.3.5" | wc -l`
# pkg_resources should give '0.3.5'
# grep should find a match and repeat it
# and wc -l should give 1 if ws4py 0.3.5 was found
#if [ $WS4PY_FOUND -eq 1 ]; then
#    echo "ws4py 0.3.5 already installed!"
#fi
# longer test from within python:
# >>> from ws4py.client.threadedclient import WebSocketClient
# >>> testclient = WebSocketClient('ws://localhost:9090/')

#
# methods to check for existence of system-installed python packages when version number is -NOT- set inside python:
# (pkg_resources won't work)
#
#if [ ! -f /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Py_-1.0.0.egg-info ]; then
#    PYPLUSPLUS_FOUND=0
#else
#    echo "pyplusplus 1.0.0 already installed!"
#    PYPLUSPLUS_FOUND=1
#fi
# alt. method is:
# this pipes stderr ("2>") to grep using ">()" and wc -l counts the number of lines
#PYTHON_FINDS_PYPLUSPLUS=`python -c "import pyplusplus" 2> >(grep -m 1 -o "ImportError") | wc -l`
# 0 if fine, 1 if get an ImportError
#if [ $PYTHON_FINDS_PYPLUSPLUS -eq 0 ]
#then
#    echo "pyplusplus python libraries found by python!"
#    PYPLUSPLUS_FOUND=1
#else
#    PYPLUSPLUS_FOUND=0
#fi

# --EOF--
